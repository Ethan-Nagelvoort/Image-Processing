%Homework 1 requires the student to manipulate and display an image called
%Flooded_house. In the assignment, this image is sperated into RGB bands,
%converted to YCbCr, subsampled, and upsampled through linear interpolation
%and row or column replication. This image and its manipulated images are
%used to calculate a variety of values including MSE and compression ratio.
%There are 11 questions in Homework 1 and the answer code is within the
%HW1SourceCode_821234668.m file. Simply run this code to see the answers to HW1.
%All question require an image to be displayed when the .m file is ran but the 
%last two questions, 10 and 11, involve calculations. These calculations are 
%displayed in the command window. Lastly, please note that you will need
%the Flooded_house jpg to have this code operate.
