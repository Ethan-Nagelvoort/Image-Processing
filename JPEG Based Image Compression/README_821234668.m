% Homework 2 requires the student to obtain two certain blocks in an image called 
% Flooded_house. In the assingment, we had to obtain the DTC coefficients and quantize
% the image using the luminescent and chrominance matrices found in the lectures.
% Then the student had to obtain DC and AC DCT coefficients through many methods, one 
% being the zigzag method. Then the student perfomed an inverse quantization and reconstructed
% the image to revert it back to tis original form. An error image and PSNR was obtained.
% There are 4 steps to homework2 and answer code is within HW2SouceCode_821234668.m file. 
% Simply run this code to see the answers to HW2. All images and calcultion results
% are obtained when this file is ran. Lastly, please note that you will need
% %the Flooded_house jpg to have this code operate.
